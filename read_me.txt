[Single-layered Multicellular Vertex Dynamics Model]

This is a MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, United States) package containing m files for the numerical simulation of the single-layered multicellular vertex dynamics model.

[Hardware requirements]
This package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations. Any non-standard hardware is not required. 


[Software requirements]
The package has been tested on the following systems:
MATLAB R2019a and later versions in both macOS Catalina (10.15.7) and Windows10.

 
[Demo]
1. Set the “vertex_lung” as the current folder
2. Run “main.m” in the command window. Make sure the “sample_lung_binary.tif” exists in the vertex_lung folder.
3. The simulated results like shown in Figure 6E are expected.
4. It will take within an hour on a normal desktop computer.


[Instructions for use]
1. Change the parameter values in the main.m file and run the code.
2. Parameters are described in the materials and methods in the manuscript or in the source code as comment lines.
